# Sample Images

Place your images in this directory and reference them in Markdown entries like:

```markdown
![Robot Design](./images/robot-design.jpg)
![CAD Model](./images/cad-model.png)
```

## Supported Formats
- PNG
- JPG/JPEG
- GIF
- SVG
- WebP

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `lift-mechanism-v2.jpg`)
- Optimize images before adding (recommended max width: 1200px)
- Use relative paths from entries: `![Description](./images/filename.jpg)`

## Video Support
You can also embed YouTube videos by including YouTube links in your Markdown:
```markdown
Check out our robot in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
```

The video will be embedded automatically (and hidden in print/PDF exports).
