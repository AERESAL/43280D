# CAD Design & Prototype Planning

## Date: September 10, 2025

### Meeting Focus
Today we focused on translating our initial concepts into detailed CAD models and planning our prototype builds.

## CAD Progress

### Catapult Design (Concept A)

**Design Specifications:**
- Launch angle: 45 degrees
- Rubber band tensioning system
- Quick-release trigger mechanism
- Estimated range: 4-6 feet

**Technical Details:**
```
Gear Ratio: 5:1
Motor: 393 High Torque (2x)
Power consumption: ~8W average
Cycle time: ~2 seconds
```

**CAD Status:** 75% complete
- Main frame: ✓ Complete
- Launch arm: ✓ Complete
- Trigger mechanism: ⚠ In progress
- Intake system: ⚠ Not started

### Lift System (Concept B)

**Design Specifications:**
- 4-bar linkage design
- Maximum height: 24 inches
- Claw-style gripper
- Linear slide extension

**Technical Details:**
```
Gear Ratio: 7:1
Motor: 393 High Torque (4x)
Power consumption: ~15W peak
Cycle time: ~4 seconds
```

**CAD Status:** 60% complete
- Lift arms: ✓ Complete
- Mounting system: ✓ Complete
- Gripper mechanism: ⚠ In progress
- Extension rails: ⚠ Not started

## Material Requirements

### Concept A (Catapult)
| Component | Quantity | Part Number |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| C-Channel 1x5x1x35 | 8 | 276-1437 |
| 393 Motors | 2 | 276-2177 |
| High Strength Gears | 12 | 276-2419 |
| Rubber Bands | 20 | - |
| Standoffs 0.5" | 24 | 276-1382 |

### Concept B (Lift)
| Component | Quantity | Part Number |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| C-Channel 1x5x1x35 | 16 | 276-1437 |
| 393 Motors | 4 | 276-2177 |
| High Strength Gears | 24 | 276-2419 |
| Linear Slides | 4 | 276-3704 |
| Standoffs 0.5" | 48 | 276-1382 |

## Decision Matrix

We created a decision matrix to help evaluate both concepts:

| Criteria | Weight | Catapult | Lift |
|----------|---------|----------|------|
| Speed | 25% | 9/10 | 6/10 |
| Accuracy | 30% | 5/10 | 9/10 |
| Reliability | 25% | 7/10 | 8/10 |
| Complexity | 10% | 8/10 | 4/10 |
| Cost | 10% | 9/10 | 6/10 |
| **Weighted Score** | - | **7.15** | **7.30** |

## Analysis

The lift system scored slightly higher in our matrix, primarily due to:
- Superior accuracy for high-goal scoring
- Better reliability in competition
- More versatile for different game elements

However, the catapult offers:
- Faster cycle times (important for qualification matches)
- Lower complexity (easier to debug)
- Lower cost (we can build backup mechanisms)

## Team Vote

After discussion, we decided to proceed with **both prototypes** simultaneously:
- Split into two sub-teams
- Build simplified versions of each design
- Test both next week
- Final decision based on empirical data

**Vote Results:** 4-0 in favor of building both prototypes

## Programming Notes

Autonomous routine planning has started:
1. Start position: Right side
2. Preload scoring: High goal
3. Intake 2 additional objects
4. Score in high goal
5. Park in designated zone

Estimated autonomous score: **18 points** (2 high goals + parking)

## Next Steps

- **By Sept 15:** Complete all CAD models
- **By Sept 17:** Order all materials
- **By Sept 20:** Begin prototype assembly
- **By Sept 24:** Testing session
