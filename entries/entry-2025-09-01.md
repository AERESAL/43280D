# Project Kickoff & Team Formation

## Date: September 1, 2025

### Meeting Objectives
- Form team and assign roles
- Review game manual
- Begin initial brainstorming

## Team Formation

Today we officially formed our VEX Robotics team for the 2025-2026 season. We have four core members:

**Roles Assigned:**
- **Captain:** Leading team strategy and coordination
- **Designer:** CAD modeling and mechanical design
- **Programmer:** Autonomous routines and driver control
- **Builder:** Physical construction and assembly

## Game Analysis

We spent 2 hours reviewing this season's game manual. Key observations:

### Scoring Opportunities
1. **High Goal:** 5 points per object
2. **Low Goal:** 2 points per object
3. **Parking:** 3 points
4. **Autonomous Bonus:** 10 points

### Strategy Notes
- High goals offer best point efficiency
- Autonomous period is critical (15 seconds)
- Need reliable scoring mechanism
- Defensive play could be valuable

## Initial Design Concepts

### Concept A: Catapult Design
**Pros:**
- Fast cycle time
- Long range capability
- Simple mechanism

**Cons:**
- Accuracy concerns
- Requires tuning
- Limited to one object type

### Concept B: Lift System
**Pros:**
- Precise placement
- Can handle multiple objects
- Reliable scoring

**Cons:**
- Slower cycle time
- More complex build
- Higher power consumption

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Complete detailed CAD models for both concepts
2. **Week 2:** Build proof-of-concept prototypes
3. **Week 3:** Test and evaluate performance
4. **Week 4:** Select final design direction

## Action Items
- [ ] Research similar designs from previous seasons
- [ ] Create detailed CAD models
- [ ] Order initial materials and parts
- [ ] Schedule next meeting for September 8th
