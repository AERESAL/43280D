## Code Examples

### Inline Code

To initialize a motor, use the `motor.spin()` function in your code.

The variable `driveSpeed` should be set between `0` and `100`.

### Code Block - Python

```python
# VEX V5 Python - Autonomous Routine
def autonomous():
    # Initialize motors
    left_motor = Motor(Ports.PORT1)
    right_motor = Motor(Ports.PORT2)
    
    # Drive forward for 2 seconds
    left_motor.spin(FORWARD, 50, PERCENT)
    right_motor.spin(FORWARD, 50, PERCENT)
    wait(2, SECONDS)
    
    # Stop motors
    left_motor.stop()
    right_motor.stop()
    
    print("Autonomous completed!")
```

### Code Block - C++

```cpp
// VEX V5 C++ - Driver Control
void opcontrol() {
    while (true) {
        // Get joystick values
        int forward = Controller1.Axis3.position();
        int turn = Controller1.Axis1.position();
        
        // Tank drive control
        LeftMotor.spin(vex::forward, forward + turn, vex::percent);
        RightMotor.spin(vex::forward, forward - turn, vex::percent);
        
        // Small delay
        vex::task::sleep(20);
    }
}
```

### Code Block - JavaScript

```javascript
// Sensor Reading Example
function readSensors() {
    const distance = RangeSensor.distance(MM);
    const rotation = InertialSensor.rotation(DEGREES);
    
    console.log(`Distance: ${distance}mm`);
    console.log(`Rotation: ${rotation}°`);
    
    return { distance, rotation };
}
```

## Horizontal Rules

You can use horizontal rules to separate sections:

---

Another way to create a horizontal rule:

***

And another way:

___

---

## Emphasis and Strong Emphasis

This is *emphasized text* (italic).

This is **strong text** (bold).

This is ***both emphasized and strong***.

---

## Math and Special Characters

### Greek Letters (common in engineering)
- Δ (Delta) - Change or difference
- θ (Theta) - Angle
- ω (Omega) - Angular velocity
- π (Pi) - 3.14159...

### Engineering Notation
- Torque: τ = r × F
- Velocity: v = d/t
- Acceleration: a = Δv/Δt
- Power: P = V × I

## Combination Example

### Meeting Summary Table with Code

| Meeting # | Date | Duration | Key Decision | Implementation |
|-----------|------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 001 | Sep 1 | 3h | Choose lift design | `liftMotor.spin()` |
| 002 | Sep 8 | 2.5h | Gear ratio 36:1 | See code below |

**Implementation Code:**

```python
# Lift control implementation
def control_lift(height):
    target_rotation = height * ROTATION_PER_INCH
    LiftMotor.spin_to_position(target_rotation, DEGREES)
```
