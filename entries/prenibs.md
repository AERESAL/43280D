### Why Δ (Delta)?

Delta (Δ) symbolizes change, a concept familiar to every robotics team. Whether it’s completely rebuilding a robot from the ground up or making incremental improvements, such as refining an intake system, change is an essential part of the process. By embracing change, we embody the spirit represented by our name, Δ (Delta).
