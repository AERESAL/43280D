# Prototype Build & Initial Testing

## Date: September 24, 2025

### Overview
Today marked our first hands-on testing session with both prototype mechanisms. This was an exciting milestone as we moved from CAD to physical testing.

## Build Status

### Catapult Prototype
**Completion:** 90%
- ✅ Frame assembled
- ✅ Launch mechanism operational
- ✅ Motors mounted and wired
- ⚠️ Trigger needs refinement
- ❌ Intake not yet attached

### Lift Prototype
**Completion:** 85%
- ✅ Main lift structure complete
- ✅ All motors installed
- ✅ Gripper mechanism functional
- ⚠️ Linear slides need adjustment
- ❌ Limit switches not installed

## Test Results

### Catapult Performance

**Test 1: Range Testing**
- Minimum range: 3.2 feet
- Maximum range: 7.8 feet
- Average range: 5.5 feet
- Consistency: ±1.2 feet

**Test 2: Accuracy Testing** (10 attempts)
- High goal hits: 4/10 (40%)
- Near misses: 3/10 (30%)
- Complete misses: 3/10 (30%)

**Test 3: Cycle Time**
- Load object: 1.2 seconds
- Launch: 0.3 seconds
- Reset: 1.5 seconds
- **Total cycle: 3.0 seconds**

**Observations:**
- Launch angle inconsistent
- Rubber band tension varies over time
- Need better object feeding mechanism
- Very fast when it works

### Lift Performance

**Test 1: Height Testing**
- Maximum height achieved: 22 inches
- Lift speed: 6 inches/second
- Lowering speed: 8 inches/second
- Stability: Excellent

**Test 2: Accuracy Testing** (10 attempts)
- High goal successful placements: 8/10 (80%)
- Dropped objects: 1/10 (10%)
- Missed placements: 1/10 (10%)

**Test 3: Cycle Time**
- Pickup: 2.1 seconds
- Lift to height: 3.0 seconds
- Release: 0.8 seconds
- Return: 2.5 seconds
- **Total cycle: 8.4 seconds**

**Observations:**
- Very accurate and consistent
- Slower than catapult (as expected)
- Gripper is reliable
- Smooth operation

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Catapult | Lift | Winner |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Accuracy | 40% | 80% | **Lift** |
| Cycle Time | 3.0s | 8.4s | **Catapult** |
| Reliability | Medium | High | **Lift** |
| Score/Minute | 4.0 | 5.7 | **Lift** |

> **Key Finding:** Despite the lift being slower, its higher accuracy results in more points per minute!

## Programming Updates

### Autonomous Routine v1
```c
void autonomous() {
    // Start with preloaded object
    moveForward(24);
    liftToHeight(HIGH_GOAL);
    releaseObject();
    liftToHeight(GROUND);
    
    // Grab second object
    intakeOn();
    moveForward(36);
    wait(1000);
    intakeOff();
    
    // Score second object
    moveBackward(36);
    liftToHeight(HIGH_GOAL);
    releaseObject();
    
    // Park
    liftToHeight(GROUND);
    moveForward(48);
}
```

**Autonomous Test Results:**
- Completed successfully: 6/10 times
- Issues: Inconsistent object pickup
- Average score: 14.5 points

## Issues Identified

### Catapult Issues
1. **Inconsistent launch angle** - Need adjustable hard stop
2. **Rubber band degradation** - Consider spring-based system
3. **Feeding mechanism needed** - Objects don't load smoothly
4. **Aiming difficulty** - Need reference marks on field

### Lift Issues
1. **Slow cycle time** - Consider faster motors or different gearing
2. **Linear slides binding** - Need better lubrication
3. **Gripper alignment** - Occasionally misses objects
4. **Weight distribution** - Front-heavy, needs counterweight

## Team Decision

After extensive testing and discussion, we voted on which design to pursue for competition:

**Final Vote: Lift System (4-0)**

### Reasoning:
1. **Consistency wins matches** - 80% accuracy is critical
2. **Higher score potential** - Despite slower cycle time
3. **More reliable** - Fewer points of failure
4. **Versatile** - Can adapt to multiple game elements
5. **Room for improvement** - Clear path to optimize speed

### Next Phase Goals:
- Improve lift cycle time to < 6 seconds
- Increase accuracy to > 90%
- Add autonomous consistency
- Build competition-ready version

## Lessons Learned

> "Speed doesn't matter if you can't score consistently. The lift system proves that reliability and accuracy are more valuable than raw speed in VEX competitions."

## Action Items

- [x] Complete prototype testing
- [x] Make design decision
- [ ] Begin competition robot build (start next week)
- [ ] Order additional parts for lift system
- [ ] Refine CAD model based on prototype feedback
- [ ] Develop optimization plan for cycle time
